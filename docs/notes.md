# Wordle Web App - Development Notes

## Project Overview [2024-12-19]
Decision to build a Wordle clone with dual game modes (Classic/Disney) using Flask + Alpine.js architecture because it provides server-side rendering with progressive enhancement while maintaining simplicity.

## Architectural Decisions

### Backend Architecture [2024-12-19]
**Decision**: Flask with application factory pattern + service layer architecture
**Rationale**: 
- Allows environment-specific configuration
- Clean separation of concerns between HTTP handling and business logic
- Repository pattern abstracts data access for testability
- Blueprint organization provides modular feature structure

### Frontend Strategy [2024-12-19]
**Decision**: Server-side rendering with Alpine.js for reactive components
**Rationale**:
- Maintains SEO benefits of server-side rendering
- Alpine.js provides Vue-like reactivity without SPA complexity
- Progressive enhancement philosophy ensures graceful degradation
- Faster initial page loads compared to full SPA approach

### Database Design [2024-12-19]
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy 2.0+ using repository pattern
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL's JSON fields provide flexibility for game data storage
- Repository pattern enables easy testing and data layer abstraction  
- Connection pooling handles concurrent users efficiently
- Flask-Migrate provides reliable schema evolution

### Authentication Strategy [2024-12-19]
**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with 15-minute access tokens
**Rationale**:
- Stateless authentication scales better than sessions
- Short token expiration reduces security risk from token theft
- Refresh token rotation provides balance of security and UX
- Flask-JWT-Extended provides robust JWT handling

### Game State Management [2024-12-19]
**Decision**: Server-side game state with JSON storage for guesses
**Rationale**:
- Prevents client-side manipulation of game state
- JSON fields allow flexible storage of guess history and feedback
- Daily puzzle system ensures consistent experience across users
- Session recovery enables cross-device continuity

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Daily puzzle distribution across time zones
**Solution**: Use UTC-based date calculation for consistent global puzzle rotation
**Impact**: All users get same puzzle on same calendar day regardless of location

**Challenge**: Dual word list management for Classic vs Disney modes
**Solution**: Single WordList model with game_mode enum and is_answer boolean flag
**Impact**: Simplified data model while supporting different word sets and validation rules

**Challenge**: Statistics calculation with guess distribution tracking
**Solution**: JSON field storing guess count distribution with service layer calculations
**Impact**: Flexible stats storage enabling rich analytics and leaderboard features

[2025-06-13]
**Challenge**: Game board UI does not match official Wordle (tile layout, spacing, animations)
**Solution**: Redesign the game board and keyboard components to closely mimic Wordle's look and feel, including tile flip animations and spacing.
**Impact**: Improved user experience and visual familiarity.

[2025-06-13]
**Challenge**: Double key entry when using physical keyboard
**Solution**: Refactor Alpine.js keyboard event handling to prevent duplicate input events.
**Impact**: Accurate and responsive keyboard input.

[2025-06-13]
**Challenge**: Mode switching sometimes fails to load puzzle
**Solution**: Add robust state management and error handling for mode switching and puzzle loading.
**Impact**: Reliable mode switching and puzzle availability.

[2025-06-13]
**Challenge**: Cannot enter guesses in the game
**Solution**: Debug and fix input handling and guess submission logic in Alpine.js and backend API.
**Impact**: Game is fully playable.

[2025-06-13] Completed Phase 5: UI/UX & Bug Fixes - Implemented in src/app/templates/game/play.html
- Redesigned game board to match official Wordle (tile layout, spacing, animations)
- Fixed double key entry from physical keyboard
- Ensured mode switching reliably loads a puzzle
- Fixed guess input logic and UI disabling
- Added ARIA roles and improved accessibility
- Updated test plan for manual/automated QA
Impact: Improved user experience, accessibility, and reliability. See src/app/templates/game/play.html for details.

[2025-06-13] Decision to finalize unlimited play and robust word lists (Classic, Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Parks) for production. Generated fresh UML, tree, and module function docs. Automated test DB index errors deferred for now (see README troubleshooting).
